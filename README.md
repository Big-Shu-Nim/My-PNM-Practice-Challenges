# My-PNM-Practice-Challenges
Attention. This repository would be no fun at all. Because I manually do the same thing to build my muscle memory in python. 

From october to December in 2021, I've been practicing a basic operation in python for data anyalyis. Like Pandas, numpy, matplotlib and a bit more packages.
However since I'm studying DNN in January this year, I've been barely using those packages. Saldy though, I'm already feeling most of my musle memory on them 
are gone. 

So I decided to practice 30mintes everyday:

    1. The things I learned in the past for manipulating datasets(2021.10.01~12.20)
    2. I will upload next learning material later(?)
